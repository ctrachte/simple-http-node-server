Why is the fs core module important for Node development?
- because it allows for file system operations that are essential to running a server

What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the fs module?
- sync = synchronous, executes code line by line, and should generally not be used because it will block the event loop.
- non-sync = asynchronous, allows your code to keep executing asynchronously allowing for faster applications. Can sometimes be problematic if you create race conditions.

Why are modules used?
- to allow the community to develop and maintain code packages that will be beneficial, reusable and clean. If everyone needs a certain functionality, why reinvent the wheel for each new application?

Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?
- to speed up development by providing additional functionality in a modular capacity. Each library can perform certain operations for you, saving you time writing code.
